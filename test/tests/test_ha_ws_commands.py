"""Add-on must use Home Assistant websocket commands that actually exist.

Regression: ha_config_entries() called {"type": "config_entries/list"}. That
command was removed from Home Assistant -- it now answers "Unknown command", which
surfaced as a bare 500 from /api/debug-config-entries and silently broke every
caller that enumerates config entries:

  * the setup-status probe for loaded / entry_loaded (the flags operators read to
    decide whether the integration is actually running);
  * auto_cleanup_legacy_state(), the legacy /share removal;
  * both cleanup fallbacks that remove esp_tree entries one by one.

The callers were wrapped in try/except that logged and continued, so the feature
degraded silently rather than erroring loudly. The live command is
`config_entries/get`, which returns a flat list whose entries carry both `domain`
and `entry_id` -- exactly what the consumers read.
