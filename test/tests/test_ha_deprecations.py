"""Guards against Home Assistant APIs and async practices that break later.

Home Assistant reports these through its own error log (`system_log/list`), not
through test failures: deprecated APIs and blocking I/O keep *working* right up
until they are removed. Our CI cannot catch them, so pin the rules here.

Each rule below records what HA logged and the version the API stops working in.
