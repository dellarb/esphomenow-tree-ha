"""Synthetic wizard placeholders must be removable.

`/api/bridge/flash-wizard/submit` registers two synthetic device rows so the wizard can
poll compile status before the real device exists:

    PLACEHOLDER_MAC        FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF   (bridge provisioning)
    REMOTE_PLACEHOLDER_MAC FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FE   (remote provisioning)

They are deliberately not real nodes, so they never appear in the bridge or retained
topology. `remove_remote` verified the target against that topology before deleting, so
a leftover placeholder could not be removed by any endpoint -- it stayed in the tree
forever as a fake offline node, showing up as a duplicate row for a remote that was
already flashed and live.

`DELETE /api/topology/remote/{mac}` now clears a placeholder directly.

These tests read the source rather than booting the app, because the route handlers are
nested closures inside `create_app` and need a full FastAPI/db stack to invoke. The
behaviour under test is *the ordering*: placeholders are handled before the topology
guard, which is exactly what was wrong.
